# AIsh üöÄ

An intelligent shell wrapper that enhances your command-line experience using AI. It seamlessly handles both shell commands and natural language queries, providing helpful suggestions and corrections when needed.

## Features

- **Smart Input Classification**: Uses AI to intelligently classify whether your input is a shell command or natural language
- **Natural Language Support**: Ask questions or make requests in plain English
- **Command Validation**: Validates commands before execution
- **Error Suggestions**: Provides helpful suggestions when commands fail or are incorrect
- **Seamless Integration**: Works exactly like a normal shell for valid commands
- **Interactive REPL**: Clean, colorful interface with persistent session
- **Configurable AI Backend**: Support for custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints and models

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aish.git
cd aish
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` and configure:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1  # Optional: custom API endpoint
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini                      # Optional: model name
```

## Usage

Run AIsh:
```bash
node index.js
```
or
```bash
npm start
```

### Examples

```bash
ai-shell> ls -la
# Executes the command normally

ai-shell> how do I find large files?
ü§ñ AI: To find large files, you can use: `find . -type f -size +100M`

ai-shell> show me current directory
ü§ñ AI: To see the current directory, use: `pwd`

ai-shell> git stats
‚ö†Ô∏è  Command not found or invalid syntax
ü§ñ AI: Did you mean `git status`? This shows the working tree status.
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+C`: Exit running command (or exit shell if no command is running)
- `exit` or `quit`: Exit AIsh

## Requirements

- Node.js 16+
- OpenAI API key (or compatible API)

## Configuration

The following environment variables can be configured in your `.env` file:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required): Your OpenAI API key
- `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` (optional): Custom API endpoint (defaults to `https://api.openai.com/v1`)
- `OPENAI_MODEL` (optional): Model to use (defaults to `gpt-4.1-mini`)

## How It Works

1. **Input Classification**: Each input is sent to the AI model to classify as either a command or natural language
2. **Command Execution**: Valid commands are executed directly in your shell with full stdio inheritance
3. **Natural Language Processing**: Questions and requests are processed by the AI to provide helpful responses
4. **Error Handling**: Invalid commands trigger AI suggestions for corrections
